# Canvas-Pracice

This is just an canvas practice project , where i have made one simple bouncing ball game. with some basic math with velocity to make it fast & slow depening on the position. 
The ball colours will also gonna generate randomly each time you click on it.

### Run Locally: 
1. Need VScode
2. Need Live Server Extension
